# MeshUI

The new UI for [Gentics Mesh](https://getmesh.io). Currently under construction.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.

## Development

1. Install Yarn (we enforce the use of Yarn over npm due to reliability issues experienced with npm)
2. `$ git clone git@github.com:gentics/mesh-ui.git`
3. `$ git checkout develop`
4. `$ yarn install`
5. `$ yarn start`
6. Download and run the Mesh Demo: https://getmesh.io/Download
7. Open `http://localhost:4200` in a browser.

## Testing

```
$ yarn test
```

## Developer Notes

### Strict null checks and the `!` operator

This project makes use of TypeScript's `strictNullChecks`. In general, we should avoid the use of the `!` non-null
assertion operator and try to make better use of correct typings, type guards and defensive programming.

This is not a hard rule and there are the following valid exceptions:

* Certain JavaScript patterns are not easy to express without falling back on `!`, for example when working with JavaScript Maps
 (See this discusion: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/9619). So we do not ban its use, but
it should be a last resort.
* In spec files we are less strict, since we are often purposefully constructing partial mock objects or creating
non-null states explicitly, so `!` is okay in specs in general if they cannot be easily avoided.
* There is a class of incorrectly-defined optional properties of the Mesh models generated by the RAML, e.g. `node.project.name`. Such
properties force the use of `!` until the RAML definitions are fixed. See https://github.com/gentics/mesh/issues/402
Once the Mesh interfaces have been fixed, that class of `!` operators can be removed.
